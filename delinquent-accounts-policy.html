                <h2>Purpose</h2>
                <p>The purpose of this policy is to establish clear expectations and procedures for the timely payment
                    of student account balances and to define the consequences of delinquent accounts at Freedom College
                    of Excellence.</p>
                <p>The policy promotes responsible financial behavior while ensuring that the College can maintain sound
                    fiscal operations. It also outlines due process measures to protect student rights related to
                    delinquent balances.</p>

                <h2>Scope</h2>
                <p>This policy applies to all students enrolled in credit-bearing programs at Freedom College of
                    Excellence, including undergraduate, graduate, and certificate programs. The policy also applies to
                    students who have withdrawn, graduated, or otherwise ceased enrollment but maintain an outstanding
                    balance with the College.</p>

                <h2>Policy Statement</h2>
                <p>Students are financially responsible for all tuition, fees, and other charges incurred while enrolled
                    at Freedom College of Excellence. All student account balances must be paid in full by the published
                    payment deadlines each term.</p>
                <p>Failure to satisfy account balances in a timely manner will result in a delinquent account status,
                    which may lead to late fees, restrictions on services, withholding of academic records, referral to
                    collections, and other actions outlined in this policy.</p>

                <h2>1. Definition of a Delinquent Account</h2>
                <p>A student account is considered <strong>delinquent</strong> when any of the following conditions
                    apply:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The account balance is past due (beyond the payment deadline established by the Bursar's
                        Office);</li>
                    <li>The student has not enrolled in an approved payment plan or their payment plan is in default;
                    </li>
                    <li>Expected financial aid or third-party payments have not been disbursed or received as
                        anticipated;</li>
                    <li>The student owes a balance from a prior term that was not resolved before the start of a new
                        term.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>2. Financial Responsibilities and Payment Obligations</h2>
                <h3>A. Responsibility for Payment</h3>
                <p>Students are responsible for ensuring that all tuition, fees, and charges are paid by the deadline,
                    regardless of financial aid or scholarship status.</p>
                <p>Students receiving financial aid must:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Meet all required documentation deadlines;</li>
                    <li>Maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP); and</li>
                    <li>Be enrolled at least half-time if receiving Title IV aid.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If financial aid does not fully cover tuition and fees, the student is responsible for the remaining
                    balance.</p>

                <h3>B. Payment Deadlines</h3>
                <p>Payment deadlines are established each term and are published in the Academic Calendar and student
                    billing statements. Students must:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pay the full balance by the published deadline; or</li>
                    <li>Enroll in an approved College Payment Plan before the deadline; or</li>
                    <li>Confirm financial aid sufficient to cover the full amount by the deadline.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>3. Consequences of a Delinquent Account</h2>
                <p>Students with delinquent accounts will be subject to the following actions:</p>

                <h3>A. Late Fees</h3>
                <p>A late fee of $50 per month will be assessed on any unpaid balance after the payment deadline. Late
                    fees accrue monthly until the balance is paid in full.</p>

                <h3>B. Academic Hold</h3>
                <p>A hold will be placed on the student's account, which prevents the student from:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Registering for future courses;</li>
                    <li>Receiving official transcripts;</li>
                    <li>Receiving diplomas or degrees;</li>
                    <li>Accessing certain College services (e.g., housing assignments, meal plans, library borrowing).
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>C. Enrollment Cancellation</h3>
                <p>If a student's account is delinquent at the end of the Add/Drop Period for the current term, the
                    College reserves the right to cancel the student's enrollment for that term.</p>
                <p>Students will be notified in writing via email and postal mail of pending cancellation. A final
                    notice will be provided at least 10 business days before cancellation takes effect.</p>

                <h3>D. Withholding of Academic Records</h3>
                <p>Students with delinquent accounts will not be issued official transcripts, diplomas, or enrollment
                    verifications until the balance is paid in full or a satisfactory payment arrangement has been made.
                </p>

                <h3>E. Referral to Collections</h3>
                <p>Accounts that remain delinquent for 90 days after the due date may be referred to an external
                    collection agency. Once referred:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Collection fees (up to 33% of the outstanding balance) may be added to the total amount owed;
                    </li>
                    <li>The delinquent account may be reported to credit bureaus, which may negatively impact the
                        student's credit score;</li>
                    <li>Further legal action, including civil judgment and wage garnishment, may be pursued in
                        accordance with applicable law.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>F. Loss of Financial Aid Eligibility</h3>
                <p>Students with delinquent accounts may lose eligibility for future financial aid disbursements and may
                    be required to resolve all outstanding balances before receiving any federal, state, or
                    institutional aid in subsequent terms.</p>

                <h2>4. Payment Plan Options</h2>
                <p>Students with balances exceeding $500 may enroll in a College-approved Payment Plan administered by
                    the Bursar's Office.</p>

                <h3>Enrollment Requirements:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Submit a Payment Plan Agreement before the term's payment deadline;</li>
                    <li>Pay a non-refundable enrollment fee ($25 per term);</li>
                    <li>Make an initial down payment (typically 25% of the total balance);</li>
                    <li>Agree to monthly installments spread across the term.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Default on Payment Plan:</h3>
                <p>Failure to make timely monthly payments results in default. Upon default:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Late fees apply to missed payments;</li>
                    <li>The student's account is moved to delinquent status;</li>
                    <li>All consequences outlined in Section 3 may apply.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>5. Account Resolution</h2>
                <h3>A. Full Payment</h3>
                <p>Students may pay the full balance at any time to resolve a delinquent account. Acceptable payment
                    methods include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cashier's check or money order;</li>
                    <li>Credit or debit card (via the student portal);</li>
                    <li>Electronic bank transfer (ACH);</li>
                    <li>Cash (in person at the Bursar's Office).</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>B. Financial Hardship Appeals</h3>
                <p>Students experiencing documented financial hardship may submit a written appeal to the Bursar's
                    Office with supporting documentation. Appeals will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.</p>
                <p>Possible outcomes may include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Extended payment plan terms;</li>
                    <li>Waiver or reduction of late fees (in exceptional cases);</li>
                    <li>Temporary hold suspension to allow for registration or transcript release.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>6. Title IV Financial Aid Implications</h2>
                <p>Students receiving Title IV federal aid must be aware that balances owed to the College can affect
                    future aid eligibility under 34 CFR §668.35 (Default Management).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Past-due balances must be resolved before future aid disbursements;</li>
                    <li>Delinquent accounts may result in loss of eligibility for aid in subsequent terms;</li>
                    <li>Return of Title IV (R2T4) regulations apply to withdrawn students with outstanding debts.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>7. Notification Procedures</h2>
                <p>Freedom College of Excellence will provide written notice of delinquent status via:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Email to the student's official College email address;</li>
                    <li>Postal mail to the mailing address on file;</li>
                    <li>Account alerts visible in the student portal.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Students are responsible for regularly checking their email and student account for billing updates
                    and notices.</p>

                <h2>8. Appeal Process</h2>
                <p>Students who believe their account has been incorrectly designated as delinquent may submit a written
                    appeal to the Bursar's Office within 15 business days of receiving notice.</p>

                <h3>Appeal Must Include:</h3>

                    <li>Written statement explaining the basis for the appeal;</li>

                    <li>Contact information for follow-up.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Resolution Timeline:</h3>
