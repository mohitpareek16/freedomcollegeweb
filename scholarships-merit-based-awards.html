                <h3>General Renewal Requirements:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Maintain the minimum cumulative GPA specified for each scholarship;</li>
                    <li>Enroll full-time (12+ credits for undergraduates; 6+ credits for graduate students) unless

                    <li>Complete any program-specific requirements (e.g., community service hours, research
                        participation).</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Probation and Loss of Scholarship:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Students who fall below the required GPA will be placed on <strong>Scholarship

                    <li>During probation, the scholarship is retained, but the student must meet the GPA requirement by
                        the end of the probationary term;</li>
                    <li>Failure to meet requirements after probation results in permanent loss of the scholarship;</li>
                    <li>Scholarships lost due to academic performance cannot be reinstated.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Stacking and Combining Awards</h2>
                <p>Students may receive multiple institutional scholarships, but total scholarship and grant aid cannot
                    exceed the cost of tuition and fees. If combined awards exceed tuition, the excess will be applied
                    to room, board, and other educational expenses.</p>
                <p>Institutional scholarships may be combined with federal, state, and external aid, subject to federal
                    and state regulations.</p>

                <h2>Impact on Financial Aid</h2>
                <p>Institutional scholarships reduce the student's financial need and may impact need-based aid
                    eligibility, including federal grants and work-study. The Financial Aid Office will recalculate the
                    student's financial aid package upon scholarship award.</p>

                <h2>Appeals and Special Circumstances</h2>
                <p>Students who experience extenuating circumstances (e.g., serious illness, family emergency) that
