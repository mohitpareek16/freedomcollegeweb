Undergraduate Admissions Policy
Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to establish clear, consistent, and equitable standards for admission to undergraduate programs at Freedom College of Excellence.

Freedom College of Excellence seeks to admit students who demonstrate the ability, motivation, and readiness to benefit from postsecondary education and to successfully complete a degree or diploma in business, healthcare, or a related professional field.

Policy Statement
Admission to Freedom College of Excellence’s undergraduate programs is based on an applicant’s prior academic preparation, professional potential, and commitment to meeting the expectations of a rigorous college-level curriculum.

Freedom College of Excellence provides equal educational opportunity to all qualified applicants and does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, national origin, age, disability, sexual orientation, or any other protected status under applicable law.
All admissions decisions are made in compliance with federal, state, and accreditor regulations.
1. General Admissions Requirements  
All applications and correspondence relevant to admission should be directed to the Office of Undergraduate Admission. Applicants are considered without regard to race, religion, sex, age, nationality, or disability. Application forms may be obtained by writing or calling:

Application Procedure
For admission to a certificate, diploma, associate, or bachelor’s degree program, an applicant is required to demonstrate the appropriate aptitude and background for the anticipated area of study. This is accomplished through the following means:
• Applicants must complete an application for admission to Freedom College of Excellence with a paid enrollment fee. • Request transcripts from all postsecondary educational institutions previously attended. 
• Before gaining formal acceptance to undergraduate programs in certain fields of study, applicants must complete an entrance evaluation. (See specific program pages for details on admission to these programs). For some programs, the university administers this evaluation free of charge. Other programs may require the use of additional testing that charges a testing fee. Submission of the student’s ACT or SAT scores, may be accepted for scores within 5 years of the test date.  Applicants who have completed a bachelor’s degree or higher, may be eligible to waive the entrance exam after review/approval from the respective college dean. 
• Applicants must submit a high school diploma, have an official General Educational Development (GED) certificate, or a homeschooled certification. Homeschooled applicants should refer to the “Homeschool Applicants” section of the catalog for more requirements. Applicants accepted into the university prior to completion of the aforementioned credential being attained are accepted contingent upon attainment of said credentials. Freedom College of Excellence will accept a student’s self-certification on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) that they have received the credential as sufficient evidence of completion. If there is reason to believe that self-certification is not valid or, if an applicant does not complete a FAFSA, Freedom College of Excellence will require additional evidence of completion. Additional evidence of completion may include an unofficial copy or picture of a transcript, a copy or picture of the diploma, a letter on school letterhead from a school official confirming completion, a copy or picture of the official GED certificate, or a certificate demonstrating that the student has passed a state-authorized examination that the state recognizes as the equivalent of a high school diploma. At its discretion, the university may recognize as equivalent to a high school diploma an academic transcript that demonstrates a student has successfully completed an associate degree (recognized by the USDOE or CHEA) or an equivalent college-level two-year program (a minimum of 60 semester credit hours.
• Any applicant/student with a criminal record should be aware that certain criminal records might make it difficult or impossible for the student to secure an externship, required clinical placement, or obtain employment in certain career fields. Some programs require background checks to be done prior to admissions. Due to ongoing changes in the facilities’ requirements, it is possible that those facilities/agencies contracted to provide the students with clinical experiences may NOT accept student vaccine waivers. Therefore, Freedom College of Excellence cannot guarantee a student who obtains a waiver for the Covid-19 or any other vaccination will be able to complete a medical program requiring clinical experiences for course completion and/or graduation purposes.
Equal Opportunity Admissions
It is the policy of Freedom College of Excellence to admit all applicants who meet Freedom College of Excellence’s academic and technical standards for admission or participation in a particular education program or activity without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, creed, sexual orientation, disability, veteran status, or age.
2. Homeschooled Applicants
Applicants who have been homeschooled will be required to self-certify that they have completed the minimum high school course of study and other legal requirements established by their state on the FAFSA. If/when a transcript is needed to verify homeschool completion beyond the self-certification, the transcript must include the student’s name, date of birth, courses taken at levels 9-12, grade earned in each course and date of graduation. A signature must also be included from the homeschool administrator to certify the validity, accuracy, and completion of the homeschool program. Homeschooled applicants are also expected to meet all other admissions requirements expected of other applicants based on program choice and level of entry.

3. Recordkeeping
The Admissions Office maintains all undergraduate admission records, supporting documentation, and decision letters for a minimum of seven (7) years after the decision date, in accordance with institutional record retention and FERPA requirements.

Readmission Policy
Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to establish clear and consistent procedures for the readmission of former students who wish to resume studies at Freedom College of Excellence. This policy ensures equitable treatment, academic integrity, and compliance with all applicable federal and state regulations, including Title IV of the Higher Education Act governing student financial aid.
Scope
This policy applies to all former students seeking readmission to any academic program, including undergraduate, graduate, and certificate programs offered by Freedom College of Excellence.
Policy Statement
Freedom College of Excellence encourages qualified former students to return and complete their studies. Readmission is not automatic; it is contingent upon academic, financial, and conduct review, as well as compliance with all regulatory and institutional requirements.
Eligibility for Readmission
Students may be considered for readmission if the following conditions are met:
- Good Standing: Students who left Freedom College of Excellence in good academic, conduct, and financial standing may apply for readmission at any time.
- Academic Dismissal: Students dismissed for academic reasons may reapply after one academic term (or longer, if required by program standards). Documentation of improved academic readiness, such as completion of remedial or prerequisite coursework, may be required.
- Conduct Dismissal: Students dismissed for disciplinary reasons must provide evidence of resolution of prior issues and demonstrate readiness to comply with Freedom College of Excellence’s Code of Conduct.
- Financial Clearance: All prior financial obligations must be satisfied before enrollment may resume. Students must also meet all current financial aid eligibility requirements.
Readmission Process
- Application: A Readmission Application Form must be submitted to the Admissions Office.
- Supporting Documentation: Applicants must provide:
o A written statement describing reasons for previous withdrawal and steps taken to ensure future academic success.
o Official transcripts for any coursework completed elsewhere.
o Program-specific documentation (e.g., updated health clearances for clinical placements).
- Review and Decision: The Admissions Committee, in consultation with Academic Affairs and Financial Services, will evaluate the application.
- Notification: Applicants will be notified in writing of the readmission decision within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of a complete application.
- Catalog Year Assignment: Readmitted students will be placed under the current catalog requirements unless an exception is approved by the Provost.

Title IV and Financial Aid Implications
- Return of Title IV (R2T4) Funds: Students who previously withdrew while receiving federal financial aid are subject to Title IV Return of Funds regulations. Before readmission, the Financial Aid Office will review the student’s prior record to determine any outstanding Title IV liabilities.
- Financial Aid Eligibility:
o Students must meet Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) requirements as defined by federal regulations and Freedom College of Excellence’s SAP Policy to regain financial aid eligibility.
o Students who do not meet SAP standards may be eligible to appeal in accordance with institutional procedures.
- Loan Repayment Status: Students who have entered loan repayment status due to withdrawal must contact their loan servicer to determine deferment or repayment eligibility upon readmission.
- Pell Grant and Lifetime Eligibility Used (LEU): The Financial Aid Office will verify remaining Pell Grant eligibility and ensure compliance with federal lifetime limits.
- Reinstatement of Aid: Financial aid will not be reinstated until the student has completed all required documentation and eligibility determinations are finalized. Students should allow sufficient processing time prior to the start of the academic term.
- Program and Cost Changes: Students returning after extended absences may be subject to updated tuition rates, program structures, and financial aid award limits based on current regulatory standards.
Special Considerations
- Program Availability: Readmission is contingent upon the continued availability of the program or course.
- Accreditation or Licensure Requirements: Students returning after extended absence may be required to meet updated accreditation, licensure, or clinical placement standards.
- Military Leave: Students returning from approved military service will be readmitted in compliance with federal and state regulations, without penalty or loss of academic standing.
Appeals
Students denied readmission may appeal the decision in writing within ten (10) business days of notification. Appeals must include supporting documentation and be addressed to the Provost or designee. The decision of the Provost is final.


Tuition and Fees Policy

Payment Plan Policy
Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to provide students with a structured and manageable method for paying tuition and fees through installment arrangements.

Freedom College of Excellence recognizes that students may need flexibility in meeting educational expenses and offers payment plan options to promote financial accessibility and continued enrollment while maintaining fiscal accountability.

Policy Statement
Students are responsible for the full payment of all tuition, fees, and related charges each term.
However, eligible students may apply for a payment plan to divide tuition and fee costs into multiple installments over the course of a semester or academic term.

All payment plans must be approved by the Business Office and must comply with institutional, state, and federal regulations, including Title IV financial aid and cash management requirements (34 CFR §668.164).
Enrollment in a payment plan is a privilege, not a right, and may be revoked for non-compliance or missed payments.

1. Eligibility
To be eligible to participate in a College payment plan, a student must:
1. Be officially enrolled in a degree, diploma, or certificate program;
2. Have an outstanding tuition and fee balance for the current term after applying all available financial aid, scholarships, and other credits;
3. Be in good financial standing with Freedom College of Excellence (no unpaid balances from prior terms); and
4. Complete a Payment Plan Agreement with the Business Office prior to the published deadline each term.
Students receiving full financial aid or third-party sponsorships that cover 100% of tuition and fees are not eligible for a payment plan.

2. Payment Plan Options
Freedom College of Excellence offers installment options based on term length and total tuition charges.
Standard plans include:
Term LengthPayment FrequencyTypical Due Dates15-week semester4 monthly installments1st of each month10–12-week term3 monthly installments1st of each month8-week accelerated session2 bi-monthly installments1st and 15th of monthThe number of payments and due dates may vary based on program structure or special session length.

All payments are due according to the terms specified in the Payment Plan Agreement.

3. Down Payment and Fees
* A down payment of at least 25% of total tuition and fees is required at the time of plan activation unless otherwise authorized by the Business Office.
* A non-refundable payment plan setup fee may be charged per term.
* A late payment fee will be assessed for each missed or delinquent installment.
* Returned payments (e.g., insufficient funds or declined transactions) may result in additional administrative fees.
All fees must be disclosed to the student in writing prior to plan enrollment.

4. Application and Approval Process
1. Students must submit a completed Payment Plan Application to the Business Office before the published tuition due date.
2. The Business Office will review the application, verify financial aid status, and calculate installment amounts.
3. The student must sign the Payment Plan Agreement outlining:
o Total balance due;
o Installment amounts and due dates;
o Accepted payment methods; and
o Consequences of late or missed payments.
4. The plan becomes active only upon receipt of the first installment and applicable fees.
Failure to submit payments by the designated due dates may result in plan cancellation.

5. Accepted Payment Methods
Payments may be made by:
* Debit or credit card;
* ACH electronic transfer;
* Check or money order payable to Freedom College of Excellence; or
* Authorized automatic withdrawal (recommended).
Cash payments are accepted only in person at the Business Office during posted hours.

6. Late or Missed Payments
If a payment is not received by the due date:
1. A late payment fee will be applied to the student’s account.
2. A hold may be placed on the student’s record, preventing registration, transcript release, or participation in future terms.
3. If the student misses more than one scheduled payment, the plan may be terminated, and the entire remaining balance will become immediately due.
4. Delinquent accounts may be referred to collections in accordance with Freedom College of Excellence’s Delinquent Account Policy.
Repeated violations of payment plan terms may result in ineligibility for future plans.

7. Withdrawal and Refund Impact
If a student withdraws from one or more courses while on a payment plan:
* The student remains responsible for any balance due after applicable refunds are calculated under the Tuition and Fees Adjustment and Refund Policy.
* Refunds (if applicable) will first be applied to outstanding payment plan balances before any funds are disbursed to the student.
* Withdrawal does not relieve the student of the obligation to satisfy the terms of the Payment Plan Agreement.

8. Interaction with Financial Aid
* Title IV financial aid and scholarships are applied to tuition and fees before calculating any remaining balance eligible for a payment plan.
* Students awaiting disbursement of approved financial aid may temporarily use a payment plan to avoid registration holds, but once aid is disbursed, it will automatically be applied to the balance due.
* If financial aid awards are reduced or canceled, the student is responsible for any resulting increase in their outstanding balance.

9. Default and Collections
Failure to meet payment obligations may result in:
* Cancellation of registration or suspension from classes;
* Withholding of transcripts, diplomas, and enrollment privileges; and
* Referral to an external collection agency, with the student responsible for any additional costs incurred (collection fees, legal fees, or interest).
All actions will comply with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) and applicable state laws.

10. Recordkeeping
All payment plan agreements, account histories, and correspondence are maintained by the Business Office for a minimum of seven (7) years following account closure or student separation, in accordance with Title IV cash management and FERPA regulations.

11.  Non-Standard Payment Plans

All students who have military and veteran benefits must provide requested documents. All other sponsor/employer documents must be provided to the Office of Student Accounts. Scholarship Grants: Scholarship and student aid grants must be applied first to direct college expenses and then to other costs. Other payment plans are available for qualifying students.

Appeals must include:
* A written explanation of extenuating circumstances (e.g., serious illness, death in the family, military deployment).
* Supporting documentation (e.g., medical verification, military orders).
Approved appeals may result in partial or full adjustments at Freedom College of Excellence’s discretion. All decisions are final.

10. Student Responsibility

D. Unofficial Withdrawal
An unofficial withdrawal occurs when a student ceases attending or participating in all courses without official notice to Freedom College of Excellence.
Determination and Consequences:
* The Last Date of Attendance (LDA) as reported by instructors will be used to determine the official withdrawal date.
* Students who unofficially withdraw will receive failing grades (“F”) for all courses not officially dropped.
* The Financial Aid Office will perform a Return of Title IV (R2T4) calculation to determine aid earned and funds to be returned.

2. Effective Date of Withdrawal
The official date of withdrawal is determined by one of the following:
* The date the student submits the signed withdrawal form to the Registrar;
* The last date of documented academic activity for students who fail to submit official notice;
* The date determined by Freedom College of Excellence for administrative withdrawals.
This date is used for all academic and financial aid calculations, including R2T4 and refund processing.

This policy applies to all students, former students, and third-party sponsors who owe tuition, fees, or other charges to Freedom College of Excellence for educational services, housing, or materials.
It applies to all programs and modalities, including on-campus, hybrid, and online courses.

Policy Statement
All students are responsible for the timely payment of tuition, fees, and other charges as outlined in their Enrollment Agreement and the Tuition and Fees Schedule published by Freedom College of Excellence.

Failure to meet financial obligations by the specified due dates results in an account being classified as delinquent.
Freedom College of Excellence reserves the right to apply late fees, impose account holds, restrict academic services, and refer delinquent accounts to external collection agencies as necessary to recover outstanding balances.

1. Definition of a Delinquent Account
An account is considered delinquent when:
* A payment is not received by the scheduled due date;
* A student defaults on an approved payment plan; or
* A balance remains unpaid after financial aid, scholarships, or third-party payments are applied.
Delinquency status begins the day after a missed payment deadline and continues until full payment or an approved repayment arrangement is made with the Business Office.

2. Notification Process
Freedom College of Excellence will notify students of delinquent accounts according to the following schedule:
Delinquency PeriodCollege Action1–14 days past dueCourtesy email and student portal notification.15–30 days past dueSecond notice issued; $25 late fee applied.31–45 days past dueFinal written notice; financial hold placed on student account.46+ days past dueAccount referred to College Collections Department or third-party agency; student may be administratively withdrawn.Each notification will include the amount due, payment options, and a deadline for resolution.
Failure to respond to these notices may result in escalation to external collection efforts.

3. Late Fees and Administrative Charges
To encourage timely payment and offset administrative costs, the following may apply:
* Late Fee: $25–$50 per missed payment or monthly billing cycle, as published in the College’s Tuition and Fees Schedule.
* Returned Payment Fee: $35 per occurrence for checks or electronic payments returned due to insufficient funds or account errors.
* Collection Fee: Accounts referred to external agencies may incur collection costs of up to 30% of the outstanding balance, plus attorney or court fees where permitted by law.

4. Financial Holds and Restrictions
A student with a delinquent account may be subject to the following restrictions until payment is made or arrangements are approved:
* Registration Hold: Student cannot register for future classes.
* Transcript Hold: Official transcripts and enrollment verifications will not be released.
* Diploma Hold: Diplomas and graduation certification will be withheld.
* Access Restriction: Access to the Learning Management System (LMS), campus services, or online course materials may be suspended.
Holds will be lifted only after the balance is paid in full or a payment plan is formally reinstated.

5. Payment Plans and Reinstatement
Students experiencing financial hardship may request a reinstatement payment plan through the Business Office prior to referral for collections.
Conditions:
* Requests must be made within 30 days of the delinquency notice.
* Payment plan terms must be documented in writing and signed by the student.
* Failure to comply with a reinstated plan may result in immediate referral to collections without further notice.
Freedom College of Excellence reserves the right to deny reinstatement for accounts with repeated defaults.

6. Referral to Collections
Accounts unpaid 60 days or more after the final notice may be referred to an external collection agency.
Once referred, all communication regarding the debt must be directed to the agency, and payment must be made directly to that agency.
Consequences:
* Additional collection costs, attorney’s fees, or court costs may be added to the balance owed.
* Collection activity may affect the student’s credit rating.
* The student will not be eligible for readmission or transcript release until the account is paid in full.
Freedom College of Excellence complies with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) and all applicable consumer protection laws governing debt collection.

7. Title IV and Financial Aid Considerations
Students receiving federal financial aid (Title IV) are responsible for any balance resulting from:
* Return of Title IV (R2T4) calculations after withdrawal or non-attendance;
* Overpayments or disbursement adjustments due to changes in enrollment;
* Financial aid ineligibility resulting from failure to meet Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP).
Unpaid balances resulting from aid adjustments are subject to the same delinquency and collection procedures outlined in this policy.

8. Administrative Withdrawal
Freedom College of Excellence reserves the right to administratively withdraw a student with a severely delinquent account (generally after 45–60 days past due) if:
* Reasonable attempts to collect payment have failed;
* The student has not made acceptable payment arrangements; or
* Continuing enrollment would result in additional unpaid obligations.
Withdrawn students remain financially responsible for all charges incurred up to the date of withdrawal, subject to applicable refund policies.

9. Debt Settlement and Disputes
Students who believe their account balance is incorrect must contact the Business Office in writing within 10 business days of the delinquency notice to dispute charges.

Disputes must include supporting documentation (e.g., payment receipts, financial aid award letters).
Freedom College of Excellence will review and respond in writing within 15 business days.
If no dispute is filed, the balance will be considered valid and collectible.

10. Refunds and Overpayments
If an overpayment is identified after resolving a delinquent account, Freedom College of Excellence will issue a refund within 14 calendar days of confirmation, in accordance with 34 CFR §668.164(e) and the College’s Refund Policy.

Refunds are issued via direct deposit or mailed check to the student’s address on record.

11. Readmission and Transcript Release After Payment
Students whose delinquent accounts have been paid in full may:
* Apply for readmission to Freedom College of Excellence (subject to approval);
* Request official transcripts or diploma release; and
* Reestablish eligibility for financial aid, if applicable.
Readmission does not automatically reinstate prior program standing or financial aid eligibility; students are subject to current catalog and policy requirements.

12. Recordkeeping

Academic Grading Policy
Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to establish consistent standards for the evaluation, assignment, and recording of student grades across all academic programs offered by Freedom College of Excellence.
This policy ensures fairness, transparency, and integrity in academic assessment while supporting accurate documentation for accreditation, regulatory compliance, and Title IV financial aid eligibility.

Scope
This policy applies to all students enrolled in credit-bearing programs and to all faculty responsible for grading in undergraduate, graduate, or certificate courses.

It governs the issuance of final grades, incomplete grades, pass/fail designations, and the processes for grade challenges and appeals.

1. Grading System and Grade Point Values
Freedom College of Excellence uses a letter grading system to evaluate student academic performance. Each letter grade corresponds to a numerical grade point value for calculating the student’s Grade Point Average (GPA).
Letter GradePercentage RangeGrade PointsDefinitionA90–100%4.0Excellent mastery of course outcomesB80–89%3.0Above-average mastery of course outcomesC70–79%2.0Satisfactory mastery of course outcomesD60–69%1.0Marginal performance, minimum passing level (undergraduate only)FBelow 60%0.0Failure to meet minimum course requirementsGraduate-level programs may require a minimum grade of B (3.0) in all courses for satisfactory performance.

Program-specific grading scales (e.g., for nursing, allied health, or technical programs) must be approved by Academic Affairs and published in the program handbook.

2. Other Grade Designations
SymbolDefinitionI (Incomplete)Temporary grade assigned when coursework cannot be completed due to extenuating circumstances (see Section 3).W (Withdrawal)Student-initiated or administrative withdrawal after the add/drop period; no credit awarded.P (Pass)Indicates successful completion of a pass/fail course; credit earned but not included in GPA.F (Fail)Indicates unsuccessful completion of a pass/fail course; no credit earned and not included in GPA.AU (Audit)Indicates student attended the course without earning credit or grade.R (Repeat)Indicates repeated course; only the most recent grade is included in GPA calculations.
3. Incomplete Grades (“I”)
An Incomplete (I) grade may be assigned when a student is unable to complete course requirements by the end of the term due to documented, exceptional circumstances beyond their control (e.g., medical emergencies, family emergencies, or military duty).
Conditions:
1. The student must have completed at least 75% of the coursework and be passing at the time of the request.
2. The student and instructor must complete an Incomplete Grade Agreement Form specifying:
o Remaining assignments or exams to be completed.
o Completion deadline (not to exceed 30 calendar days from the start of the next term).
o Default grade to be assigned if work is not completed.
3. The instructor submits the completed form to the Registrar’s Office for approval and recordkeeping.
Conversion of “I” Grades:
* Upon submission of completed work, the instructor assigns the final grade.
* If the student fails to complete the required work by the deadline, the grade automatically converts to the default grade (typically an “F”).
* Extensions may only be granted with written approval from the Academic Dean.

4. Pass/Fail Grading Option
Certain courses may be designated as Pass/Fail (P/F) based on curriculum design, such as internships, externships, clinical experiences, or non-academic seminars.
Conditions:
* A grade of “P” indicates satisfactory performance and completion of all required learning outcomes.
* A grade of “F” indicates unsatisfactory performance.
* Pass/Fail courses do not affect GPA, but credits earned count toward program completion and Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) calculations.
* The Pass/Fail option must be approved by the Academic Affairs Committee prior to course offering.

5. Grade Posting and Notification
* Final grades are submitted by faculty through Freedom College of Excellence’s Learning Management System (LMS) or grade submission portal within five (5) business days after the end of the term.
* Students may view final grades via the official student portal.
* Grades are considered final once posted, subject only to correction of documented error or formal appeal.

6. Grade Changes and Corrections
Grade changes are permitted only to correct documented clerical, computational, or administrative errors.
Process:
1. The instructor submits a Grade Change Form with explanation and supporting documentation to the Academic Dean.
2. The change must be approved by the Dean or Registrar within 30 calendar days after the end of the term.
3. The corrected grade becomes part of the student’s permanent academic record.
No grade changes may be made after a degree has been conferred.

7. Grade Challenge Procedure
Students who believe a grade was assigned in error may initiate a Grade Challenge within ten (10) business days of the grade posting.
Step 1 – Informal Resolution:
* The student contacts the instructor directly to discuss the concern.
* Most disputes should be resolved through this informal discussion.
Step 2 – Formal Grade Challenge:
If unresolved, the student may submit a written Grade Challenge Form to the Program Director or Academic Dean, including:
* The course name and term.
* The specific grade being challenged.
* A clear explanation and supporting evidence (e.g., graded assignments, rubrics, or email correspondence).
The Program Director or Dean will:
1. Review the documentation and may consult the instructor.
2. Issue a written decision within ten (10) business days.
3. If the student disagrees, they may proceed to the Grade Appeal process (Section 8).

8. Grade Appeal Procedure
If the student believes the grading decision involved procedural error, bias, discrimination, or unfair treatment, they may submit a formal Grade Appeal within ten (10) business days of the challenge decision.
Step 1 – Submission:
* The student submits a written Grade Appeal to the Provost or Chief Academic Officer (CAO), detailing the basis of appeal and providing documentation.
Step 2 – Review:
* The CAO convenes an Academic Appeals Committee consisting of at least three faculty or academic administrators not involved in the original grading.
* The committee reviews all materials and may meet with both the student and instructor.
Step 3 – Decision:
* The Committee issues a written recommendation to the CAO within 15 business days.
* The CAO renders a final decision within five (5) business days of receiving the recommendation.
* The decision of the CAO is final and binding.
All grade challenges and appeals are documented in the student’s academic file.

9. Repeated Courses
* Students may repeat failed or low-graded courses to improve GPA or meet program requirements.
* Only the most recent grade is used in GPA calculation, though all attempts remain on the transcript.
* Students may not receive financial aid for repeated coursework beyond allowable limits as defined by Title IV regulations.

10. Academic Integrity and Grading
Grades must reflect the student’s own academic performance.

Violations of the Academic Integrity Policy (e.g., cheating, plagiarism, falsified work) may result in grade penalties, course failure, or disciplinary action as described in institutional policy.

11. Recordkeeping and Confidentiality
All grades, grade changes, and appeals will be recorded and retained in the student’s permanent academic record in accordance with FERPA and institutional data retention policies.

Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) Policy
Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to ensure that all students maintain satisfactory academic progress toward the successful completion of their program of study.

This policy fulfills federal and accreditor requirements for institutions participating in Title IV federal student aid programs, and it promotes academic excellence, accountability, and student success.

Scope
This policy applies to all students enrolled in degree or certificate programs at Freedom College of Excellence, regardless of enrollment status (full-time or part-time) or funding source.
The SAP evaluation process applies to all terms of enrollment, including periods during which a student does not receive federal financial aid.

Policy Statement
To remain in good academic standing and retain eligibility for federal financial aid, students must meet three standards of Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP):
1. Qualitative Standard (Cumulative Grade Point Average – GPA)
2. Quantitative Standard (Pace of Completion)
3. Maximum Time Frame
All three standards are measured at the end of each evaluation period, which is typically each academic term (quarter, trimester, or semester).

1. Qualitative Standard (GPA Requirement)
Students must maintain a minimum cumulative GPA based on their program level:
Program LevelMinimum Cumulative GPAUndergraduate (Diploma, Certificate, Associate, Bachelor’s)2.0Graduate (Master’s or Professional)3.0* Only grades earned at Freedom College of Excellence are used to calculate the cumulative GPA.
* Transfer credits accepted toward the student’s program are not included in GPA calculations.
* Grades of A, B, C, D, and F are used in GPA calculations; grades of I (Incomplete), W (Withdrawal), or P (Pass) are not included but count as attempted hours for pace and maximum time frame calculations.

2. Quantitative Standard (Pace of Completion)
Students must successfully complete a minimum percentage of all credits attempted to ensure timely program completion.
Minimum Pace Requirement:
* Students must successfully complete at least 67% of all attempted credit hours.
Calculation Formula:
Pace=Cumulative Credits CompletedCumulative Credits Attempted\text{Pace} = \frac{\text{Cumulative Credits Completed}}{\text{Cumulative Credits Attempted}}Pace=Cumulative Credits AttemptedCumulative Credits Completed? 
Examples of Attempted Credits:
* All courses registered after the add/drop period
* Transfer credits accepted toward the program
* Repeated and remedial courses
* Withdrawals and incompletes
Failure to meet the 67% completion rate may result in loss of financial aid eligibility and academic standing consequences.

3. Maximum Time Frame
Students must complete their program within a time frame not exceeding 150% of the published length of the program, measured in credit hours.
Examples:
Program Type/LengthMaximum TimeframeDiploma – 30 credits45 attempted creditsAssociate Degree – 60 credits90 attempted creditsBachelor’s Degree – 120 credits180 attempted creditsMaster’s Degree – 36 credits54 attempted creditsAll attempted credits—including withdrawals, incompletes, repeated courses, and accepted transfer credits—count toward the maximum time frame.

4. SAP Evaluation Period
* SAP is evaluated at the end of each academic term after grades are posted.
* Both qualitative (GPA) and quantitative (Pace and Time Frame) standards are reviewed simultaneously.
* Students who meet all standards remain in Good Standing.
* Students who fail to meet one or more standards enter Warning, Probation, or Dismissal status as described below.

5. SAP Statuses and Financial Aid Eligibility
A. Good Standing
Students meeting all SAP standards are considered in Good Academic Standing and remain eligible for Title IV financial aid.

B. Financial Aid Warning
* Students who fail to meet SAP standards for the first time are placed on Financial Aid Warning for one term.
* Students remain eligible for financial aid during the warning period.
* The student must meet all SAP requirements by the end of the next term to regain Good Standing.
* Failure to meet SAP standards after the warning term results in loss of aid eligibility unless the student successfully appeals and is placed on Probation.

C. Financial Aid Probation
* Students who fail to meet SAP after the warning term may submit a SAP Appeal if extenuating circumstances (e.g., illness, death in the family, military service) prevented academic success.
* Approved appeals result in Financial Aid Probation for one term, during which the student remains eligible for aid.
* The student must either meet SAP standards by the end of the probation term or follow an Academic Success Plan approved by the Academic Dean.
* Failure to meet conditions of the plan results in Financial Aid Suspension and loss of eligibility.

D. Financial Aid Suspension / Academic Dismissal
* Students who fail to meet SAP standards after the probation period are placed on Financial Aid Suspension and may be academically dismissed from Freedom College of Excellence.
* Students in this status are ineligible for Title IV financial aid and may only be reinstated upon successful appeal or after completing coursework at their own expense to meet SAP standards.

6. SAP Appeal Process
Students who lose financial aid eligibility due to SAP failure may appeal within ten (10) business days of notification.
Appeal Requirements:
* A written statement explaining the circumstances that affected academic performance (e.g., illness, family emergency, personal hardship).
* Documentation supporting the claim (e.g., medical records, death certificate, military orders).
* Explanation of corrective actions taken to prevent recurrence.
* If applicable, an Academic Success Plan signed by the student and advisor.
Appeal Review:
* Appeals are reviewed by the SAP Appeals Committee, which includes representatives from Financial Aid, Academic Affairs, and Student Services.
* Students are notified in writing of the decision within 15 business days.
* Approved appeals result in reinstatement on Probation; denied appeals result in continued Suspension.

7. Reinstatement of Financial Aid Eligibility
Students may regain financial aid eligibility by:
1. Successfully appealing and being placed on Probation, or
2. Meeting SAP standards at their own expense before reapplying for aid.
Reinstatement is not automatic and must be verified by the Financial Aid Office prior to any disbursement of federal funds.

8. Treatment of Specific Grades and Coursework
Course Type / GradeCounts as Attempted?Counts as Completed?Counts Toward GPA?Transfer CreditsYesYesNoIncompletes (I)YesNoNoWithdrawals (W)YesNoNoRepeated CoursesYesYes (most recent grade used)YesRemedial CoursesYesYesYesPass/FailYesPass = CompletedNo
9. Communication and Documentation
* SAP results are communicated in writing via official College communication channels (student email and portal).
* All evaluations, appeals, and decisions are documented and maintained in the student’s academic and financial aid files for at least seven (7) years in accordance with federal record retention requirements.

10. Academic Success Plan
Students on Probation may be required to follow an Academic Success Plan developed jointly by Academic Advising and Financial Aid.

The plan may include:
* Mandatory tutoring or academic support sessions.
* Limited course loads or enrollment restrictions.
* Regular progress meetings with advisors.
* GPA or completion benchmarks for the probationary term.

 Credit Hour Policy
Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to define how Freedom College of Excellence assigns and awards academic credit to courses and programs in a manner consistent with federal regulations, accrediting body standards, and recognized practices in higher education.

This policy ensures that all credit-bearing coursework—regardless of delivery method—reflects equivalent academic rigor, student learning outcomes, and instructional time.

Scope
This policy applies to all credit-bearing courses and programs offered by Freedom College of Excellence at the undergraduate and graduate levels, including on-campus, hybrid, and online courses.

Policy Statement
Freedom College of Excellence uses the semester credit hour as the standard measure of academic credit.
A credit hour represents the amount of work expected to achieve intended learning outcomes as verified by student achievement, consistent with the following federal definition:
Federal Definition (34 CFR §600.2):
One credit hour is an amount of work represented in intended learning outcomes and verified by evidence of student achievement that reasonably approximates:
* One hour of direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out-of-class student work each week for approximately fifteen (15) weeks for one semester hour of credit, or the equivalent amount of work over a different amount of time; or
* At least an equivalent amount of work for other academic activities as established by the institution, including laboratory work, internships, practicums, studio work, and other academic work leading to the award of credit hours.

1. Semester System Definition
Freedom College of Excellence operates on a semester calendar consisting of two primary semesters (Fall and Spring) of approximately 15 weeks each, plus optional summer or accelerated sessions.
* One semester credit hour generally represents 45 hours of total student engagement, including instruction, assignments, assessments, and independent study.
* The academic year typically consists of 30 weeks of instruction, excluding breaks and final examinations.

2. Credit Hour Calculation by Course Type
A. Lecture (Didactic) Courses
* One (1) semester credit hour is awarded for a course that meets one hour per week (50 minutes of direct instruction) over a 15-week semester, with a minimum of two additional hours per week of out-of-class student work.
* Equivalent credit may be earned for courses offered in condensed or online formats when total instructional and student engagement time meets the same standard.
Example:
1 credit hour = 15 contact hours + 30 hours of outside study = 45 total student learning hours.

B. Laboratory or Skills-Based Courses
* One (1) semester credit hour is typically awarded for two to three hours of laboratory or supervised practice per week for 15 weeks, depending on the instructional intensity and learning outcomes.
* The ratio of contact hours to credit hours may vary by discipline, consistent with accreditor and programmatic requirements (e.g., health sciences, technical training).
Example:
1 credit hour = 30–45 lab contact hours per semester.

C. Clinical, Externship, or Practicum Courses
* Credit hours are assigned based on the expected total learning time required to achieve course outcomes, including direct supervision, fieldwork, and academic oversight.
* A typical standard is 45–60 hours of supervised clinical or externship activity per credit hour.
* The number of credit hours assigned must reflect the complexity and academic rigor of the experience rather than contact hours alone.

D. Independent Study, Directed Research, or Capstone Projects
* Credit is awarded based on documented evidence of student effort and faculty oversight equivalent to the total workload of a traditional course of the same credit value (minimum 45 hours per credit hour).
* Faculty and students must complete a Learning Contract specifying objectives, deliverables, and methods of evaluation.

E. Online and Hybrid Courses
* Credit hours for online or hybrid courses are equivalent to those for traditional on-campus courses.
* Online courses must provide a combination of faculty-led instruction, substantive interaction, and student engagement activities that reasonably approximate the total time commitment required in a face-to-face format.
* Freedom College of Excellence ensures “regular and substantive interaction” in compliance with 34 CFR §600.2 and §602.17(g).

3. Academic Oversight and Approval
* The Curriculum Committee, in collaboration with the Academic Affairs Office, is responsible for determining the appropriate number of credit hours for each course and program during the curriculum development and review process.
* Credit hour assignments must be justified based on documented instructional time, learning outcomes, and workload expectations.
* Any changes to credit hour assignments must receive prior approval through the College’s formal curriculum governance process.

4. Compliance and Periodic Review
To ensure ongoing compliance and consistency:
1. Freedom College of Excellence will conduct periodic internal audits of course syllabi, schedules, and learning outcomes to verify that credit hour assignments align with this policy.
2. Faculty syllabi must clearly identify:
o Total instructional contact hours;
o Expected out-of-class work; and
o Learning activities supporting credit hour equivalency.
3. Freedom College of Excellence will provide documentation of credit hour assignments during accreditation visits and Title IV audits, as required.

5. Documentation Requirements
Each course syllabus must include the following:
* Credit hour value and rationale.
* Total number of contact hours (lecture, lab, clinical, or online).
* Estimated out-of-class work hours.
* Learning objectives aligned with credit-hour expectations.
Program files maintained by Academic Affairs must include:
* Curriculum maps and credit hour justifications.
* Faculty contact logs for clinical or externship oversight.
* Audit and review reports verifying credit-hour compliance.

6. Relationship to Financial Aid Eligibility
The determination of credit hours directly affects student enrollment status and financial aid eligibility.
Credit hour assignments must align with the U.S. Department of Education’s definition of “credit hour” to ensure that disbursed Title IV funds are properly supported by academic activity.

Any misalignment or overstatement of credit hours may result in financial aid recalculations, Return of Title IV (R2T4) requirements, or program adjustments.

7. Definitions
* Credit Hour: A unit of academic measurement representing the amount of student work required to achieve course learning outcomes as defined above.
* Contact Hour: A period of direct faculty instruction, typically defined as 50 minutes of classroom or direct faculty-led activity.
* Out-of-Class Work: Academic activities such as reading, research, writing, projects, or studying that occur outside of scheduled instructional time.
* Semester: A term of approximately 15 instructional weeks, exclusive of registration, examination, and break periods.

Classification of Students Policy
Purpose
This policy defines the categories used by Freedom College of Excellence to classify students for academic, administrative, and financial purposes.

Proper classification ensures accurate reporting, appropriate academic advising, and compliance with institutional, accreditor, and federal regulations.

Policy Statement
All students enrolled at Freedom College of Excellence are classified according to academic level, enrollment status, and degree-seeking intent.

Classifications are determined at the time of admission and may change as students progress through their programs or modify their enrollment.

Maximum Course Load Policy
Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to define the maximum number of credit hours a student may enroll in during a single academic term.

Freedom College of Excellence limits course loads to promote academic success, maintain instructional quality, and ensure compliance with federal and accreditor standards for satisfactory academic progress and student workload.

Policy Statement
Freedom College of Excellence recognizes that students’ academic success is best supported when course loads are reasonable and aligned with the student’s academic ability, personal responsibilities, and previous performance.

Course load limits apply to all students, regardless of enrollment type or program modality (on-campus, hybrid, or online).
Students are expected to maintain a manageable schedule to ensure consistent progress toward graduation while preserving academic quality and personal well-being.

1. Standard Course Load
Program LevelFull-Time Course Load (Standard)Maximum Course Load (Without Approval)Undergraduate (Associate/Bachelor’s)12–15 semester credits per term18 semester credits per termGraduate (Master’s/Professional)9 semester credits per term12 semester credits per term* Students are considered full-time when enrolled in at least 12 semester credits (undergraduate) or 9 semester credits (graduate).
* The standard full-time load is designed to allow students to complete degree requirements within the normal program length as published in the catalog.

2. Maximum Course Load Limits
A. Without Special Approval
Students may register for up to 18 semester credits (undergraduate) or 12 semester credits (graduate) in a standard 15-week term without special approval.
B. With Special Approval
Students requesting to exceed the standard maximum must obtain written approval from the Academic Dean or Program Director prior to registration.
Requests will be considered only if the student meets all of the following conditions:
1. Has completed at least one term at Freedom College of Excellence;
2. Has a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0;
3. Is in Good Academic Standing with no probationary status;
4. Demonstrates satisfactory academic progress (SAP) per institutional policy; and
5. Has no record of course withdrawals, incompletes, or failing grades in the prior term.
C. Absolute Limits
Under no circumstances may a student register for more than:
* 21 semester credits at the undergraduate level; or
* 15 semester credits at the graduate level in a standard term.
These limits apply even with administrative approval.

3. Summer and Accelerated Terms
Course load limits for shorter or accelerated terms are adjusted proportionally to maintain equivalent workload standards.
Term LengthUndergraduate MaximumGraduate Maximum8-week term9 credits6 credits5-week term6 credits3–4 creditsSummer term (10–12 weeks)9–12 credits6–9 creditsStudents enrolling in compressed or accelerated sessions are encouraged to consult their Academic Advisor to ensure the workload is manageable given the condensed schedule.

4. Online and Hybrid Course Load
For students enrolled in online or hybrid programs, the same credit hour limits apply.
However, students are advised that online coursework may require additional time for reading, participation, and independent assignments.
Students new to online learning may initially be limited to a reduced load (typically 9–12 credits) during their first term at the discretion of the Academic Dean.

5. Program-Specific Restrictions
Certain programs—particularly in healthcare disciplines with clinical or laboratory components—may have lower maximum course load limits due to program intensity and accreditation requirements.
Such limits are specified in the Program Handbook and supersede this general policy.

6. Appeals for Course Overload
Students who do not meet the GPA or standing requirements but wish to request an overload may submit a Course Overload Appeal to the Dean of Academic Affairs.
The appeal must include:
* A written statement explaining the reason for the request;
* Documentation of time management and academic preparedness; and
* Endorsement from the student’s Academic Advisor or Program Director.
The Dean’s decision is final. If approved, the overload is valid for one term only and must be reauthorized each subsequent term if requested again.

7. Financial Aid and Title IV Considerations
* Enrollment status (full-time, half-time, or less than half-time) determines Title IV financial aid eligibility and disbursement.
* Exceeding the maximum course load does not result in additional financial aid eligibility.
* Course withdrawals, incompletes, or failures resulting from overloads may negatively impact Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) and future aid eligibility.
Students are responsible for understanding how course load adjustments may affect their financial aid awards and program completion timeframes.

8. Administrative Oversight
* The Registrar’s Office monitors course loads each term and enforces limits during registration.
* Any unauthorized overloads may be reduced to comply with this policy.
* Academic Advisors must counsel students regarding workload balance, degree planning, and potential consequences of excessive credit loads.

In accordance with FERPA, Freedom College of Excellence protects the privacy of student education records and affords each eligible student certain rights with respect to those records.

1. Student Rights Under FERPA
FERPA affords students the following rights with respect to their education records:
A. The Right to Inspect and Review
Students have the right to inspect and review their education records within 45 days of submitting a written request to the Registrar’s Office or other appropriate official.
Freedom College of Excellence will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where records may be reviewed. If the requested records are not maintained by Freedom College of Excellence official receiving the request, that official will direct the student to the appropriate custodian.
B. The Right to Request Amendment of Records
Students may request an amendment to their education records if they believe information is inaccurate, misleading, or in violation of their rights.
Requests must be submitted in writing to the Registrar, clearly identifying the part of the record to be changed and explaining why it should be amended.
If Freedom College of Excellence denies the request, the student will be informed in writing of the decision and of the right to a hearing.
C. The Right to Consent to Disclosure
Students have the right to control disclosure of personally identifiable information contained in their education records, except where FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent (see Section 2 below).
Freedom College of Excellence will not release such information without the student’s written consent unless permitted by law.
D. The Right to File a Complaint
Students have the right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by Freedom College of Excellence to comply with FERPA requirements:
Family Policy Compliance Office

2. Disclosure of Information Without Student Consent
FERPA permits Freedom College of Excellence to disclose information without a student’s prior written consent under certain circumstances, including but not limited to:
1. College officials with legitimate educational interests (faculty, staff, or contractors performing institutional services).
2. Officials of another institution where the student seeks or intends to enroll.
3. Authorized federal, state, or accrediting agencies conducting audits or evaluations.
4. Financial aid purposes, including eligibility determination, award amount, or enforcement of aid terms.
5. Compliance with judicial orders or lawfully issued subpoenas (with advance notice to the student when required).
6. Health or safety emergencies involving immediate or significant threats to the student or others.
7. Parents of dependent students as defined by the Internal Revenue Code, if dependency status is documented.
8. Victims of certain disciplinary proceedings as allowed under FERPA regulations.

3. Directory Information
Freedom College of Excellence may disclose “directory information” without prior consent unless the student has submitted a written request to restrict release.
Directory information includes:
* Student’s name
* Address, phone number, and email address
* Program of study and enrollment status (full-time/part-time)
* Dates of attendance
* Degrees, honors, and awards received
* Participation in officially recognized activities
* Most recent educational institution attended
Opt-Out Option:
Students who wish to restrict the release of their directory information must submit a Request to Withhold Directory Information Form to the Registrar’s Office within ten (10) business days of the start of the academic term.

The restriction remains in effect until the student submits written authorization to lift it.

4. Record of Access
Freedom College of Excellence maintains a record of all individuals or agencies (other than College officials) that request or obtain access to student education records. This record is available for student inspection upon request.

5. Security and Maintenance of Records
Freedom College of Excellence maintains education records in a secure environment to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure.

Access to student records is restricted to authorized personnel who require the information to perform legitimate institutional duties.

6. Student Identification and Communication
To protect privacy, Freedom College of Excellence does not release or discuss student records by phone or email unless the student’s identity can be verified.

Students must use official College communication channels (e.g., College email) when requesting access to or release of educational information.

7. Special Considerations for Online and Clinical Programs
For programs that involve distance learning, externships, or clinical placements, Freedom College of Excellence may share limited educational information (such as course progress or professional conduct documentation) with partnering organizations as required for program participation, in accordance with FERPA’s legitimate educational interest provisions.
